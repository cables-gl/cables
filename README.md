[cables.gl](https://cables.gl) and [cables standalone](https://cables.gl/standalone) are mainly developed by [undev](https://undev.studio/),
with contributions by the [cables community](https://discord.gg/cablesgl) and support by [various other parties and projects](https://cables.gl/support).

## Development

### Set up local environment

* the preferred way of developing cables locally is using the `cables_dev` repository: https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_dev
* that repo contains scripts that will set up everything for you to get started
* Read up about setting up everything for you to start contributing to cables in the section on ["Developing Cables"](https://cables.gl/docs/6_1_developing_cables/developing_cables)
  of the official cables documentation.

## Giving Feedback

### Issue Workflow

- create an issue, pick "Bug report" or "Feature Request" from the templates
- the issue will be assigned a "new" label
- we will check on these issues regularly, add them to a milestone and remove the "new" label
- once we added the feature or fixed the bug in any release (also dev/nightly) we will close the issue
- stable releases will have a changelog with all the closed issues
