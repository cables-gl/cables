# Developing Ops

## Basic Setup

## Adding Ports and Port types

Different port examples below.

Floating point number ports in and out:
```javascript
const inFloat = op.inFloat("float in");
const outNumber = op.outNumber("number out");
```
Integer number ports in and out:
```javascript
const inInt = op.inFloat("int in");
const outNumber = op.outNumber("number out");
```
String ports in and out:
```javascript
const inString = op.inString("String in");
const outString = op.outString("String out");
```

Boolean ports in and out:
```javascript
const inBoolean = op.inBool("Boolean in");
const outBoolean = op.outBool("Boolean out");
```

Trigger ports in and out:
```javascript
const execute = op.inTrigger("Trigger In");
const trigger = op.outTrigger("Trigger out");
```
Array ports in and out:
```javascript
const inArray = op.inArray("Array in");
const outArray = op.outArray("Array out");
```

Object ports in and out:
```javascript
const inObject = op.inObject("Object In");
const outObject = op.outObject("Object Out");
```


See [Ports](../dev_creating_ports/dev_creating_ports.md)


### Op Constructor

The code you write inside your op will be executed once the op is added to the patch-view.
All your initialisation-code should be in the root of your code, e.g.

```javascript
var inPort = op.inFloat("My Input Port");
var outPort = op.outNumber("My Output Port");

// put your initialisation code here
...
```

At this state the links between ops / the port-values are not set, yet, we will come to this later…

`op` is a pre-defined object which bundles all the functions you need to interact with the world of cables.


## Callbacks and Events

### port.onChange

For every input-port (except `inTrigger` and `inTriggerButton`) you can implement the `onChange`-method which gets called every time the value on the port changes. This means that it is being called when:

- the user entered a new value in the GUI (input field / moved a slider / checkbox / …)
- Another op linked to this port
- A link was removed

When a link to a value or string-value port was removed the old value (from the form) will be set again. If the old value is the same as the value from the linked op `onChange` will **not** be called, so it is only called if the value actually changed.

If a connection to an object or array-port is removed the port will contain `null`.

Follow this [link](../dev_callbacks/dev_callbacks.md) for more information on Callbacks


### Naming Conventions

#### Op Names

UpperCamelCase, e.g. `KeyPressLearn` (`Ops.Devices.Keyboard.KeyPressLearn`). If your op has an abbreviation in it with multiple big letters in a row (e.g. `MIDI`), write only the first letter in capitals, e.g. `Ops.WebAudio.MidiLearn`

#### Port Names

Use capitals with spaces for the user-visible names in the op-settings, e.g. `Inner Radius`. You can use all capital letters for port names like `BPM` or `MIDI`.
Feel free to use whatever you prefer in code, most common is lowerCamelCase, e.g. `innerRadius`.  
If your op has one main-port which is needed to trigger it, call it `Execute`, if your op has an output-port to trigger other ops call it `Trigger`


```javascript
var innerRadius = op.addInPort("Inner Radius");
```

# Op Documentation

Every op should have an example on how to use it. Just link to the public patches / examples which use your new op. It is good practice to include a minimal example at first which demonstrates the basic usage without all the bells and whistles. In a second one you could show a more advanced use-case.

Click this [link](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Trigger.TriggerLimiter) for an example of how you can write clear documentation for your new op.

When you create a new op it automatically creates a documentation page for you. Click your op and then click the **view documentation** link in the UI pane to browse to the new page.<br>
![Button](img/dev_ops_view_documentation_link.png)

Scroll down the page and then click **edit this document** to create all of your documentation for your new op.<br>
![Button](img/dev_ops_edit_this_document.png)

You can now fill in all the details and documentation for your new op !

### Publishing Ops

If you made an op and think it would be useful for other users get in touch with the cables-staff (via Slack or the [cables forum](https://forum.cables.gl/)).
