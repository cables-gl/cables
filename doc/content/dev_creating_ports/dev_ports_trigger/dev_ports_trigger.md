# Trigger Ports

This page will explain how to create an input and output port of the type`Trigger`and how to make a `Button` in the UI pane of the op which can be clicked with the mouse to trigger an event<br>

Trigger ports are used to trigger another op. If you have a patch that creates visuals then you need to add the`MainLoop op`which has a `trigger port`. This updates all connected ports 60 times a second.
Trigger ports can also be triggered under certain conditions <br>
For example the `Mouse op` sends a trigger out of the `click port` once a user has clicked in the preview pane

```javascript
//strict mode allows us to write cleaner code
"use strict";

//Create a input port of the type Trigger
const inExecute  = op.inTrigger("Trigger In",{"display": "button"});
//create a button in UI panel of the op which can be clicked
const inButton   = op.inTriggerButton("Press me");

//Create a output port of the type Trigger
const outTrigger = op.outTrigger("Trigger out");

//when input port is triggered call the function 'update'
inExecute.onTriggered = update;
//if user presses the button in the op pane call function 'update'
inButton.onTriggered = update;

//this function runs every time the input port is triggered
function update()
{
    //send a trigger out of the output port
    outTrigger.trigger();    
}
```
