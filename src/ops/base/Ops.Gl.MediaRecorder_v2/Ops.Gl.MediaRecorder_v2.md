uses the browser to record the renderer-output to any videocodec supported by your browser

As the MediaRecorder API does not create a video file duration, the video you download from your browser won't have a duration or seekable timeline - giving you some trouble when importing your video into a video editor application or the like. Most online social media services ignore this hiccup so generally it is fine to ignore. However if you need to have a videofile with a seekable timeline and proper duration you'll have to manually reencode/fix the video file generated by MediaRecorder.
