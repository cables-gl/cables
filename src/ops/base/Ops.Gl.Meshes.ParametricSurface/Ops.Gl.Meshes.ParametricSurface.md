A parametric surface is a surface in 3d space that is defined by a parametric equation of 2 parameters.

Simplified, it is a mapping from (u, v) -> (x, y, z).

With this op, you have the possibility to define your own parametric surfaces by specifying a function for each 3d component (x, y, z). These functions may include all mathematic operations javascript is capable of. 

For a reference of mathematical functions availible, please refer to the Javascript Math object: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math

There are presets you can choose from, which are a good starting point if you are unfamiliar with the mathematics.
